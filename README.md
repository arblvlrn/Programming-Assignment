ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:

In this code, a function alphabet_soup(x) is defined to take a word as input and return the letters in alphabetical order. The sorted(x) function sorts the characters in the input word, and ''.join() is used to combine the sorted letters back into a single string. Finally, the result is printed, which shows the sorted version of the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".


EMOTICON PROBLEM:

This code defines a function replace(sentence) that takes a sentence and replaces specific words with corresponding emoticons using a dictionary emoticon_map. The function loops through each word in the dictionary, replacing occurrences of the word in the sentence with its associated emoticon. Finally, it returns and prints the modified sentence, where words like "smile" or "mad" are replaced with emoticons like :) or >:(


UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM:

In this code, the function unpack(cat) is designed to extract and print the first, middle, and last elements from a list of cat breeds. It first stores and removes the first element using cat.pop(0), then stores the remaining elements as the middle, and stores the last element using cat[-1] before removing it with cat.pop(-1). Finally, it prints the first, middle, and last elements, showing how the list has been "unpacked."
