ALPHABET SOUP PROBLEM:

In this code, a function alphabet_soup(x) is defined to take a word as input and return the letters in alphabetical order. The sorted(x) function sorts the characters in the input word, and ''.join() is used to combine the sorted letters back into a single string. Finally, the result is printed, which shows the sorted version of the word "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
